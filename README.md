# rhoCentralRK4Foam
    
rhoCentralRK4Foam is derived from rhoCentralFoam by replacing its first-order time advancement scheme with a third-order, four stage Runge-Kutta scheme. The main purpose of developing this solver is to improve the scaling performance of rhoCentralFoam, especially in large-scale simulations.
